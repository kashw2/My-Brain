Horizontal Flip / Mirrored Image

In the above example **A** is the mirrored image because it's left becomes it's right while not changing it's vertical status.

In this example **D** is the correct answer as the #, $, @ and & symbols have been flipped to face the left and have had their position flipped as well

In this example **D** is the answer, this is because the top arrow and the lines associated with it have been flipped and the bottom arrow has also been flipped but has maintained it's position in the same corner

# Vertical Flip

In this example **B** is the answer as it has been flipped vertically, the semi circle has been moved to the top and the right angle has had it's orientation changed to face the bottom.

Further more, it is not option A as the right angle in the sample is pointing to the left so therefore must also point to the left in the answer.

In this example, **D** is the answer as it has been vertically flipped and all elements are flipped as if they were to be turned upside down.

In this example **A** is the correct answer, the reasoning is:

The first fold is a [[Abstract Reasoning/Introduction#Horizontal|Horizontal Flip]], the second is a [[Abstract Reasoning/Introduction#Vertical|Vertical Flip]]. This means that upon unfolding, you will first be given a Vertically flipped image, upon unfolding again, you would be given a Horizontally flipped image.

The reason the cut in the A on the first unfold is facing the otherway to how the bottom A's slash is, is because only the whole shape cannot have it's orientation flipped horizontally, however certain aspect inside of the shape may.
