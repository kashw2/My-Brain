In this example, the answer is **4** as in each image we can see that the base image from A -> B is rotated to the **RIGHT** 90 degrees, following this, both items are then [[Abstract Reasoning/Introduction#Vertical|Vertically Flipped]]

In this example, **A** is the answer as the pattern between 1 -> 2 is that the object in 1 is [[Abstract Reasoning/Introduction#Horizontal|Horizontally Flipped]] before having a itself duplicated on the bottom with the duplicate being the result of itself being [[Abstract Reasoning/Introduction#Vertical|Vertically Flipped]]
