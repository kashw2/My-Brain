In this example, the answer is **4** as in each image we can see that the base image from A -> B is rotated to the **RIGHT** 90 degrees, following this, both items are then [[Abstract Reasoning/Introduction#Horizontal|Horizontally Flipped]]

2.

In this example, **A** is the answer as the pattern between 1 -> 2 is that the object in 1 is [[Abstract Reasoning/Introduction#Horizontal|Horizontally Flipped]] before having a itself duplicated on the bottom with the duplicate being the result of itself being [[Abstract Reasoning/Introduction#Vertical|Vertically Flipped]]

In this example, **B** is the correct answer, to figure this out:

- Find the pattern in the change that occurs from images A -> B, that being:
	- The outermost shape only has one of itself
	- The two inner shapes are the same
	- On B, the innermost shape has positioned itself to the top left of the previous outermost shape, overlapping it where the two now inner shapes have become what the previous outermost shape was

In this example, **C** is the answer.

The above image denotes the pattern in which the items move in the image.

Between 2 and 3 however, there is a mutation that happens between the items which sees it no longer just move it's position to the next spot but also change to a new item that isn't already in the image.

In this example, **C** is the answer.

We can think of the shapes as petals, we can see that to form the next shape, the shaded petal moves 3 'petals' anti-clockwise whereas the unshaded, 3 'petals' clockwise. While doing so the shaded part of the shaded image is found on the inside and there are no flips occurring.
