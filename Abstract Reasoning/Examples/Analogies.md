In this example, the answer is **4** as in each image we can see that the base image from A -> B is rotated to the **RIGHT** 90 degrees, following this, both items are then [[Abstract Reasoning/Introduction#Vertical|Vertically Flipped]]

In this example, **A** is the answer as the pattern between 1 -> 2 is that the object in 1 is [[Abstract Reasoning/Introduction#Horizontal|Horizontally Flipped]] before having a itself duplicated on the bottom with the duplicate being the result of itself being [[Abstract Reasoning/Introduction#Vertical|Vertically Flipped]]

In this example, **B** is the correct answer, to figure this out:

- Find the pattern in the change that occurs from images A -> B, that being:
	- The outermost shape only has one of itself
	- The two inner shapes are the same
	- On B, the innermost shape has positioned itself to the top left of the previous outermost shape, overlapping it where the two now inner shapes have become what the previous outermost shape was

In this example, **C** is the answer
