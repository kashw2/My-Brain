## Introduction to First Aid

What is First Aid?
- Helping behaviours and initial care provided for an acute illness or injury

A First Aid provider is someone who can:
- **Recognise** the need for **First Aid**
- **Recognise** Limitations of **First Aid**
- **Assess** the need for **First Aid**
- **Prioritise** the need for **First Aid**
- **Provide First Aid**
- **Seek** Additional care

---
### Objectives

The 5 Ps'

1. Preserve - Life
2. Protect - The Unconscious / Casualty
3. Prevent - The condition from worsening
4. Promote - Recovery
5. Provide - Reassurance

---
### ANZCOR

Australian New Zealand Committee on Resuscitation

Members include:
- Australian Resuscitation Council (ARC)
- New Zealand Resuscitation Council (NZRC)

Through **ANZCOR**, both Australian and New Zealand interests are represented on the **International Liaison Committee of Resuscitation**.

---
### Legal Considerations

#### Consent and Capacity to Consent

##### Consent

Consent is **Required** when the patients:

- Decision is voluntary
- Decision is informed
- Decision covers the first aid treatment to be performed
- They have the [[#Legal Considerations#Consent and Capacity to Consent#Capacity|Capacity To Provide]] consent
- Are not in immediate and emergency circumstances implied due to risk of loss of life

In cases where dealing with a **Minor**, [[#Consent]] can be obtained from a **Parents** / **Guardian**

##### Capacity

A patient **Lacks** the **Capacity** to [[#Consent|Consent]] when the patient is someone who:

- Is a **Minor** - Person under 18 in **Queensland**
- Has diminished ability to understand or communicate the nature and consequences of their own decision

---
### Duty of Care

#### Training

First Aid providers **MUST**:

- Be trained and hold recognised statements of attainment for the competencies
- Follow guidelines determined by international peer reviewed evidence
- Strive to follow **[[#ANZCOR]]** recommendations on refreshing CPR knowledge. 

#### Workplace

Workplaces **MUST**:

- Provide First Aid equipment
- Ensure access to facilities for First Aid administration
- Ensure there is an adequate number of trained first aid officers proportional to the number of employees

---
### Duty to Assist

- Australian law does **NOT** compel you to render assistance
- Some employees with First Aid training are expected to offer assistance to workmates if needed
- Queensland law places an obligation on the driver of a motor vehicle to render assistance when involved in an accident
- Obligation can be taken on voluntarily
- Required to act in [[#Negligence|good faith and without recklessness]]
- Good Samaritan - Act with reasonable care and skill
- Volunteer - In accordance with organisation policies and procedures have a **[[#Duty to Assist]]** 

#### Example Scenarios

1. A driver of a vehicle or rider of an animal is involved in a traffic accident and someone dies or is injured. The driver has a [[#Duty to Assist]] and must not knowingly fail to stop to give assistance.

---
### Negligence

Occurs if:

- You fail to act in accordance with your first aid training
- You act outside the limits of your first aid training (Scope of Practice)

---

### Ethical Issues

#### Code of Practice

Governed by the [First aid in the workplace code of practice 2014](https://www.worksafe.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/20901/first-aid-in-the-workplace-cop-2014.pdf). 

Used to provide practical guidance for:

- People undertaking duties under the WHS Act
- Businesses undertaking duties under the WHS Act

The 'Code' provides information on:

- First Aid Kits
- Procedures
- Facilities
- Training

Applicable to all workplaces covered by the WHS Act.

The Code of Practice addresses topics such as:

- Privacy and Confidentiality
- Cultural awareness and sensitivity
- Knowing your skills and limitations
- Providing information on casuality condition to other EMS personnel

#### Social

- Treat everyone with respect and observe their rights not to be touched or treated
- Understand barriers
	- Gender
	- Language
	- Religion
- Respect beliefs
- Provide privacy and dignity
- Retain confidentiality
- Adhere to consent

#### Communication

Guidelines

- Communicate in an assertive but non aggressive manner
- Speak clearly
- Use appropriate language
- Adjust communication styles to suit the causality's level of consciousness

---
### Report and Recording

It's a good practice to keep a record of any first aid treatment undertaken. This can be done:

- Verbally to [[SES/FireCom|FireCom]]
- Wordback
- SHE Report
- Notebook Entry

#### Requirements

- Only use a black / blue pen
- Record only **FACTS**
- Maintain confidentiality
- Sign and date
- Cross errors out with a single line and initial
- Use a scribe if available and appropriate

---
### Handovers

Handovers refer to the process of quickly transferring care from an initial first aid responder to emergency service personnel a process known as **IMISTAMPLE** is used to do this.

**I** - Introduce casualty
**M** - Mechanism of injury
**I** - Injuries identified
**S** - Signs and symptoms
**T** - Treatment
**A** - Allergies
**M** - Medications
**P** - Previous injury or illness
**L** - Last input and output
**E** - Events leading to the crisis

---
### WHS & Manual Handling

#### Manual Handling

Manual handling is any form of work that may require:

- Pushing
- Pulling
- Lifting
- Lowering
- Moving
- Holding things, animals or persons

Involvement with first aid:

- Carrying first aid kits or other equipment to the casualty
- Moving the casualty away from a hazard to make it easier to provide treatment

What do we need to know and understand to avoid injury?

- Understand your own limitations and strength
- Avoid bending or twisting your back when lifting
- Be careful not to twist or bend a casualty's neck or back
- If you are to move a casualty, [[SES/PLAN|PLAN]] what you are going to do and explain your plan to the casualty

---
### Communicable Diseases

#### What are they?

Any disease that can be communicated from one person to another such as:

- Colds
- Flu
- STI's
- COVID-19
- SARS

#### How they are transmitted

Communicable diseases are transmitted through contact such as:

- Blood
- Saliva
- Faeces
- Herpes
- Hepatitis

#### Vector borne

Vector borne illnesses are Human illnesses caused by parasites, viruses and bacteria that are transmitted by vectors, common examples include but are not limited to:

- Malaria
- Dengue
- Japanese Encephalitis

A **Vector** is an organism that can function as a carrier or transmitter of an illness.

##### Standard Precautions

The following steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of infection:

1. Washing hands
2. Covering exposed cuts
3. Wearing disposable gloves
4. Changing gloves between treatment of casualties
5. Using a mask
6. Wearing eye protection
7. Not eating or drinking in first aid areas while providing treatment or care

---
### Needle stick injury

- Wash with soapy water
- Apply antiseptic
- Cover with a dressing / band aid
- Seek medical attention and inform
	- How long ago it occurred
	- How deep penetration was
	- Was the needle contaminated
- Follow organisation reporting process

---
### Debriefing

Encourage people involved in an incident to talk to a **Peer Support Officer** / [[SES/FESSN|FESSN]].

Follow stress management techniques such as:

- Accepting that that are events you cannot control
- Learning to relax
- Being assertive instead of aggressive
- Talking with trusted and understanding confidant
- Healthy diet
- Having adequate rest
- Having scheduled leisure time

---
## Responding to an Emergency Situation

### Basic Life Support

#### DRSABCD

DRSABCD is the recommended process to follow when administering first aid.

**D** - Danger
**R** - Response
**S** - Send (Request Assistance)
**A** - Airway
**B** - Breathing
**C** - CPR (30x Chest Compression - 2x Breaths)
**D** - Defibrillation

### Emergency Action Plan

Sometimes due to the proximity to QAS, initial responders may not progress past the **EAP** stage.

Emergencies can be either medical or trauma related.

Steps:
1. [[#Scene Survey|Surveying]] the scene
2. Determine if the scene is safe
3. [[#Calling for help|Phone for help]]
4. Assessing for life threatening injuries
5. Conducting [[#Secondary Survey|secondary survey]]

---
### Scene Survey

Maintain situational awareness by:

- Ensuring the scene is safe for all in the area
- Reduce risk of existing hazards
- Determine what has happened
- Determine the number and nature of casualties
- Use bystanders to call for help

---

### Triage

Triage is the process of categorising casualties into order of treatment.

Those who are at greater risk of death are prioritised

---

### Calling for help

Australia wide the emergency number is: **000**
FRS & RFS gain assistance from: **FireCom**
SES gain assistance from: **000**

Deaf people can use TTY/TDD phones on: **106**

Secondary emergency number: **112**

---
### Phoning QAS

The following prompts will be asked:

- Exact location
- The nearest cross street
- The number you are calling from
- What has happened
- Number of casualties, their injuries, condition and age
- Are you with the casualty
- Is the casualty conscious / breathing

---

### Road Traffic Crash Priorities

When attending an **RTC** it is suggested you follow the following in conjunction with any operational or organisation directives:

- Turn off the ignition
- Isolate the battery where possible
- Remove negative terminal first
- Be aware of fallen powerlines
- Remain at least 10 metres away
- Be aware of inground power supply
- Remove ignition sources

#### Chemicals / HAZMAT

- Attempt to ID using placards
- Call 000
- Maintain safe distance
- Wait for specialist assistance

## Assess for life threatening injuries

Assess vital signs including:

- [[#Level of Consciousness|Response]]
- [[#Airways|Airway]]
- [[#Breathing|Breathing]]
- Life threatening bleeding

#### COWS

Use the **COWS** acronym when checking for response:

**C** - Can you hear me?
**O** - Open your eyes!
**W** - What's your name?
**S** - Squeeze my hands!

These prompts are used to determine **casualty orientation** to **time**, **place**, **commands**, **[[#Level of consciousness|level of consciousness]]** and **assessing reflexes/strength/function/impairment**.
#### Level of Consciousness

Use the **AVPU** system to measure and record a casualties level of consciousness.

**A** - Alert
**V** - Verbal
**P** - Pain
**U** - Unresponsive

Unconscious casualties are those that are unable to:

- Protect themselves
- Manage their airway

Manage an unconscious casualty where you find them unless:

- Their life or yours is in jeopardy
- Required to reposition to manage life threatening bleed, airways or allow aid to be given

#### Airways

To ensure appropriate airway management, do the following:

- Do not tilt the head until the mouth has been cleared
- Dentures are only removed if they are loose
- All foreign material (blood, vomit, food etc) needs to be removed
- Basic airway manoeuvre can prevent asphyxiation

Tilting the head can cause obstructions to move further into the airway

Dentures stay in as they provide support if CPR is required

Foreign objects are removed by two finder sweeping methods

#### Breathing

To ascertain if a casualty is breathing or not do the following:

- Look - Rise and fall of chest
- Listen - For air escaping the nose 
- Feel - Feel for air movement and movement of the upper abdomen/lower chest

Respiration Rates:

- Newborns 40 - 60 bpm
- 1 - 12 mths 25 - 40 bpm
- 1 - 5 yrs 25 - 30 bpm
- 6 - 12 yrs 16 - 25 bpm
- > 12 yrs 12 - 20 bpm

##### Inhalation

Air pressure in the chest is less than outside

##### Exhalation

Air pressure in the chest is greater than outside

---

### Recovery (lateral) Position

Care of the airway takes priority over any other injury unless there is an obvious arterial bleed that required immediate attention.

---

### Life Threatening Bleeding

Bleeding is considered life threatening when it can not be controlled by pressure.

Steps:
- Find where the victim is bleeding from
	- Open or remove the clothing so you can see the wound
- Look for and identify life threatening bleeding
	- Blood that is spurting out
	- Blood that wont stop coming out
	- Blood that is pooling on the ground
	- Clothes that are soaked with blood
	- Bandages that are soaked with blood
	- Loss of all or part of an arm or leg
	- Bleeding in a victim who is now confused or unconscious

---
## Resuscitation

#### Cardiac Arrest

- Early Recognition and call for help
- Early CPR is begin within 4 minutes of the heart stopping
- Early defibrillation within 9 - 12 minutes
- Post resus care, clearing the airways and administering medication

### Priorities in an Emergency

Assess the situation for DANGER.

Ensure the safety of:

- Rescuer
- Bystanders
- Casualty
- Commence appropriate treatment following the [[#Basic Life Support]] flowchart

Do not move the casualty unless:

- Extreme weather conditions deem it essential
- To make possible the care of airways
- To make possible the control of severe bleeding

**Airways take priority over any fractures or broken bones**

### Response

Is the casualty:

- Conscious
- Semi conscious
- Unconscious

In difference situations different techniques may be applied to determine Response:

- Adults / Children (**[[#COWS]]**)
- Infant (Gently squeeze or flick the soles of the feet)

### Opening the Airway

#### Adults / Children

Assuming a [[#Airways|clear airway]]:
- Tilt the head backwards
- Lift the chin; or
- Jaw thrust

#### Infant

Assuming a [[#Airways|clear airway]]:
- Perform a jaw lift

#### Reasoning

- Anatomical differences
	- Infant head is larger and the neck is shorter
	- Chest is smaller
	- Sternum is softer
	- Upper airway is easily obstructed
	- Tranchea is soft
	- Tongue is relatively large
	- Enlargement of tonsils and adenoids increase tenancy for obstruction 
	- Infants nose breath 

---
### Airway assessment

A casualty should not be routinely rolled onto the side to assess airways

---

### Breathing

Normal breathing is dependant on casualty, use the guide provided in [[#Breathing]]

#### Methods of Rescue

**Adult**: Two full breaths
**Child**: Two gentle puffs
**Infant**: Two very gentle puffs

---
### Compressions

Compression should start if there is:
- No breathing
- Abnormal breathing

Compressions should:
- Start in the middle of the chest
- Be at a rate of 100 - 120 per minute
- Go to a depth of 1/3 of the chest depth
- Allow full chest recoil

**Method**:
- Adult - Two hands
- Child - One hand
- Infant - Two fingers

#### CPR Cycle

##### Regular Cycle

- 30x Compressions
- 2x Breaths

5x Cycles in 2 minutes

##### Compression Only CPR

Continue chest compressions

---

### Resuscitation

During resuscitation the following can occur:

- Vomit
	- Wipe the mouth clean
	- Ensure using gloves
	- Roll the casualty onto their side
	- Remove external material and allow drainage to occur
	- Two finger sweep if required
- Late Pregnancy
	- Place a pillow or similar under the right buttock
	- Lay them on their back with shoulders flat
- Mouth to stoma rescue breathing
	- Place the head in a backward tilt position
	- Make an airtight seal with your lips around the stoma
	- Blow for one second
	- Give rescue breaths

### Defibrillation

And AED is used only for people who are unresponsive and not breathing normally

CPR must be continued until the AED is turned on and pads attached

**For every minute defibrillation is delayed, there is a ~10% reduction in chance of survival**

#### AED Setup and Use

- Attach the AED pads and follow verbal prompts
- Casualty may need to have excessive hair removed

### Ceasing CPR

You can cease CPR when:

- Casualty responds or begins breathing normally
- You are in danger
- It is impossible to continue
- A health care professional takes over
- A health care professional directs you to stop
