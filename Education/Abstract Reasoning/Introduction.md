 Abstract Reasoning tests ones ability to **Identify Patterns**, **Logical Rules** and **Trends**.

## Types

### Vertical / Horizontal Flip

#### Horizontal
Also known as **Mirrored**
- Inverted **Horizontally**
- Right Hand Side becomes your Left Hand Side and vice versa
- Top and Bottom remain as they are
- [[VerticalHorizontalFlip#Horizontal Flip|Example]]

#### Vertical
Also known as **Watered**
- Inverted **Vertically**
- Bottom becomes your Top and vice versa
- Left and Right remain as they are
- [[VerticalHorizontalFlip#Vertical Flip|Example]]

### Analogy

- Uses relationships to determine the next image in a sequence
- Can make use of other [[#Types]] of abstract reasoning
- [[Analogies|Examples]]

### Odd One Out

- Uses patterns of relationships between a sequence to determine what image in the sequence is non conforming
- [[OddOneOut|Examples]]

### Rearrangement

- Uses a pattern of relationships in a sequence
	- Movement of items
	- Position swapping
	- Directional and or orientation
