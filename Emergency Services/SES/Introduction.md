A client is any external stakeholder that requests service from the SES.

An example of the above is:
- When a local community (Usually an **External Stakeholder**) in times of need requests the assistance of the SES, this transitions them to a **Client**.
- When QPS is searching for a missing person and enlists the help of the SES, this transitions them to a **Client**.
